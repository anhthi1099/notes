# GIT HUB LESSON
1. To clone a file/ folder by Github:
Use the syntax: git clone /paste the SSH links here/
For example: To clone the repo Training-Repo, go to the folderr then get the SSH key.
Next, in the command prompt or in the VS code terminal, type in **git clone git@github.com:anhthi1099/Training-Repo.git"**
2. To check the status, commit, add, stage
* The command **git status** to check whether anything is modified or added into the repo.  
* The command **git add /name of the file/** to add the files into the stage or to make it shorter, we can use **git add .**
* To save the file, we do have to add a message too. The syntax will be **git commit -m "abc"**. The message should be descriptive to make sure the ones that edit files later will be able to catch up
